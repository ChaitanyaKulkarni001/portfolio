## Honored to Serve Shri Vitthal Rukmini Mandir Committee, Pandharpur

> "Serving with devotion is the highest form of contribution."

In 2025, I had the sacred opportunity to contribute to the Shri Vitthal Rukmini Mandir Committee, Pandharpur—a name that resonates with deep spiritual and cultural reverence across Maharashtra.

This was not just another project for me. Being recognized and entrusted by the Committee was a mark of immense **faith**, **respect**, and **honor**. It symbolized the intersection of **technology** and **devotion**, and reminded me that our skills, when used for good, can support traditions and serve divine purposes.

### A Personal Milestone

- Humbled to contribute to a legacy rooted in centuries of faith.
- Grateful for the trust placed in me by the Committee.
- Proud moment shared with my family and community.

> This honor is a cherished milestone in both my personal and professional journey.
