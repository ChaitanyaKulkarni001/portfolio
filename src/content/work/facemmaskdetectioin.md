## Face Mask Detection

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Peter Drucker

The **Face Mask Detection** project is a machine learning application designed to determine if individuals are wearing face masks. Leveraging OpenCV and Python, this model is a response to the increasing need for health safety measures.

### Key Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes OpenCV to accurately detect face masks on individuals.
- **Real-time Detection:** Capable of processing video feeds for instant feedback on mask usage.
- **User Interface:** Built with Node.js, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive experience.
### Team Collaboration

This project was developed during the **Sinhgad Hackathon**, where I had the opportunity to lead a talented team of four members:
- **Shreya Supekar**
- **Chaitanya Kulkarni**
- **Ishwari Dole**
- **Aarti Maske**

Together, we combined our skills and expertise to create an effective solution for face mask detection through teamwork.

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** For implementing the machine learning model and using OpenCV for image processing.
- **Node.js:** To manage the backend and handle requests.
- **HTML/CSS:** For creating the front-end interface for user interaction.
