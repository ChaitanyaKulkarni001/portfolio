## Cat vs. Dog Classifier

> "The more we learn, the more we realize how much we don't know." - Aristotle

The **Cat vs. Dog Classifier** is a deep learning model designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. This project demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.

### Key Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Designed with convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for classification.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Applied data augmentation techniques like rescaling, flipping, and zooming to improve generalization.
- **Model Training:** Trained using binary cross-entropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent optimization.
- **Testing & Validation:** Validated the model with unseen images and tested it with new datasets to ensure robustness.

### Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used for building and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV:** For image preprocessing and visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** For plotting results and performance metrics.
